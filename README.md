First repository. Thank you guide!

Hello! 

I'm excited to begin my foray into programming and all of its concomitant branches. 
When writing this, I have yet to learn even the basics of prgramming, 
though, like many others who have begun this journey, Harvard's CS50 will help 
launch me forward. Github will act as yet another important guide along my journey. 

Thank you!
